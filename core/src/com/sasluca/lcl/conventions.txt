LCL - Crossplatform UI framework for libGDX using Overlap2D and Spine

Conventions:

Code made by someone else:
    -classes made by other people have the EXT prefix
    ex: EXTBitmapFontWriter

Variables:
    -variables use camel case, unless they are final, in which case they must be in ALL CAPS.
    ex: int number
        final int PADDING

    -protected variables always start with the prefix "p_".
    ex: protected int p_Number
        protected final int p_NUMBER

    -private variables always start with the prefix "m_".
    ex: private int m_Number;
        private final int m_NUMBER;

Static:
    -public static non-final variables start with a capital letter
    ex: SpriteBatch
        ResourceManager

Getters:
    -always add the prefix "get" or "is" to getters depending on how it is grammatically correct, if those prefixes are not grammatically correct then use the correct ones.
    ex: getColor()
        isLooping()

Setters:
    -always add the prefix "set" to setters.
    ex: setColor(Color newColor)
        setLooping(boolean loop)

    -void should be replaced with a <THIS> generic that return a reference to the object. THIS is used for method chaining.
    -if grammatically correct arguments should have the word "new" as a prefix, otherwise let the argument be called something else.
    ex: setColor(Color newColor) //Do this
        setLooping(boolean newLooping) //Don't do this, instead...
        setLooping(boolean loop) //Do this

Interfaces:
    -if grammatically correct interfaces should have the suffix "able".
    ex: IRenderable
        IUpdatable

    -if an interface contains getters and setters always put the getters first and then the setters.
    -start with a capital 'I' prefix, this includes functional ones.
    ex: IBehaviour (functional)
        IRenderable
        IUpdate

Classes:
    -start with the "LCL" prefix.
    ex: LCLSprite
        LCLStateManager

UI elements:
    -start with the "UI" prefix.
    ex: UILabel
        UITextArea
        UIButton
        UITextBox

Input events:
    -start with the "IE" prefix.
    ex: IETouchDown
        IETouchUp
        IEKeyDown
